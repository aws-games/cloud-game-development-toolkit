# Cloud Game Development Toolkit

[![License: MIT-0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-0)](LICENSE)

The **Cloud Game Development Toolkit (a.k.a. CGD Toolkit)** is a collection of infrastructure as code templates and configurations for deploying common game development infrastructure and tools on AWS. 

The **Toolkit** consists of four key components:

1. **Assets**: Reusable Amazon Machine Image (AMI) templates written in [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) for Windows and Linux build machines as well as Perforce Helix Core and Helix Swarm workloads.

2. **Modules**: Highly configurable and extensible [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) modules for simplified deployment of key game development infrastructure on AWS with best-practices by default.

3. **Samples**: Complete Terraform configurations for expedited studio setup that demonstrate module usage and integration with other AWS services.

4. **Playbooks**: Automation scripts written with [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) to configure workloads after deployment.

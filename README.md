# Cloud Game Development Toolkit

[![License: MIT-0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-0)](LICENSE)

The **Cloud Game Development Toolkit (a.k.a. CGD Toolkit)** is a collection of templates and configurations for deploying game development infrastructure and tools on AWS. 

The project is designed for piecemeal usage:

- Already have a CI/CD pipeline deployed but need a build machine image? :white_check_mark:
- Looking to migrate your Perforce server from on-premise to AWS? :white_check_mark:
- Starting your new studio from the ground up and looking for pre-built templates to deploy common infrastructure? :white_check_mark:

The **Toolkit** consists of four key components:

| Component | Description
|-|-|
|**Assets**| Reusable scripts, pipeline definitions, Dockerfiles, [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) templates, and other resources that might prove useful or are dependencies of any of the modules. 
|**Modules**| Highly configurable and extensible [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) modules for simplified deployment of key game development infrastructure on AWS with best-practices by default.
|**Samples**| Complete Terraform configurations for expedited studio setup that demonstrate module usage and integration with other AWS services.
|**Playbooks**| Automation scripts written with [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) to configure workloads after deployment.

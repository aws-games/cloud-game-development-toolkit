# CGD Toolkit Standards - Legacy Rule

This rule has been restructured into focused rules for better efficiency:

1. **amazon-q-operation.md** - General operation guidelines, task management, context handling
2. **cgd-toolkit-design.md** - Project-specific design standards and AWS provider best practices  
3. **development-hygiene.md** - Testing, documentation, security scanning, and workflow standards
4. **cgd-toolkit-module-standards.md** - **GOLD STANDARD** for all module development (takes ultimate preference)

**CRITICAL**: For any module development work, use **cgd-toolkit-module-standards.md** as the absolute authority. This rule contains the agreed-upon gold standards that take precedence over all other design guidance.

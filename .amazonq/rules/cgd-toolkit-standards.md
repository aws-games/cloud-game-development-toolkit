# CGD Toolkit Standards - Legacy Rule

This rule has been restructured into three focused rules for better efficiency:

1. **amazon-q-operation.md** - General operation guidelines, task management, context handling
2. **cgd-toolkit-design.md** - Project-specific design standards and AWS provider best practices  
3. **development-hygiene.md** - Testing, documentation, security scanning, and workflow standards

Please refer to the individual rules above for specific guidance.

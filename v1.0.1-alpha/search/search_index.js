If you would like to see something in this repository please create a feature request in the Issues tab. If you'd like to contribute, raise a pull request. You'll find our contribution guidelines here.</p> <p>The Cloud Game Development Toolkit (a.k.a. CGD Toolkit) is a collection of templates and configurations for deploying game development infrastructure and tools on AWS.</p> <p>Below are key tenets driving project's focus:</p> <ul> <li>This is a fork-first, open-source project. We know that every game project is unique, so fork the repo, create your own branches for customization, and sync as appropriate. If you build something that can benefit other game developers, feel free to share via PR, as we encourage contributions!</li> <li>Meet game developers where they are. We aim to minimize learning curves and introducing new technologies where possible by building solutions that incorporate tools and software that are already widely used across the game industry and among our existing AWS for Games customers.</li> <li>Solutions are built for AWS. This project is focused on improving the game development experience on AWS and does not try to standardize solutions for deployment across many hosting platforms. In our experience, doing so is generally difficult, unecessary, and fraught with tradeoffs. If AWS is not your jam, you're welcome to fork and customize as needed (see above)!</li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":"<p>Getting Started</p>"},{"location":"index.html#license","title":"License","text":"<p>This project is licensed under the MIT-0 License.</p>"},{"location":"changelog.html","title":"Changelog","text":""},{"location":"changelog.html#unreleased","title":"Unreleased","text":""},{"location":"changelog.html#v101-alpha-2024-09-16","title":"v1.0.1-alpha -

Selecting the right instance type for your build farm is highly dependent on your build process. Larger instances are more expensive, but provide improved performance. For example, large Unreal Engine compilation jobs will perform significantly better on Compute Optimized instances, while cook jobs tend to benefit from the increased RAM available from Memory Optimized instances. It can be a good practice to provision an EC2 instance using your custom AMI, and run your build process locally to determine the right instance size for your build farm.

For example, *.example.com protects corp.example.com, and images.example.com. The wild-card name will appear in the Subject field and in the Subject Alternative Name extension of the ACM certificate.</p> <p>b. When you request a wild-card certificate, the asterisk (*) must be in the leftmost position of the domain name and can protect only one subdomain level. For example, *.example.com can protect login.example.com, and test.example.com, but it cannot protect test.login.example.com. Also note that *.example.com protects only the subdomains of example.com, it does not protect the bare or apex domain (example.com). To protect both, see the next step.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>In compliance with RFC 5280, the length of the domain name (technically, the Common Name) that you enter in this step cannot exceed 64 octets (characters), including periods. Each subsequent Subject Alternative Name (SAN) that you provide, as in the next step, can be up to 253 octets in length.</p> <p>c. To add another name, choose Add another name to this certificate and type the name in the text box. This is useful for protecting both a bare or apex domain (such as example.com) and its subdomains such as *.example.com).</p> </li> <li> <p>In the Validation method section, choose either DNS validation \u2013 recommended or Email validation, depending on your needs.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>If you are able to edit your DNS configuration, we recommend that you use DNS domain validation rather than email validation. DNS validation has multiple benefits over email validation. See DNS validation.</p> <p>a. Before ACM issues a certificate, it validates that you own or control the domain names in your certificate request. You can use either email validation or DNS validation.</p> <p>b. If you choose email validation, ACM sends validation email to three contact addresses registered in the WHOIS database, and up to five common system administration addresses for each domain name. You or an authorized representative must reply to one of these email messages. For more information, see Email validation.</p> <p>c. If you use DNS validation, you simply add a CNAME record provided by ACM to your DNS configuration. For more information about DNS validation, see DNS validation.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the Key algorithm section, chose one of the three available algorithms:</p> <ul> <li>RSA 2048 (default)</li> <li>ECDSA P 256</li> <li>ECDSA P 384</li> </ul> <p>a. For information to help you choose an algorithm, see Key algorithms and the AWS blog post How to evaluate and use ECDSA certificates in AWS Certificate Manager.</p> </li> </ol> <p>5.In the Tags page, you can optionally tag your certificate. Tags are key-value pairs that serve as metadata for identifying and organizing AWS resources. For a list of ACM tag parameters and for instructions on how to add tags to certificates after creation, see Tagging AWS Certificate Manager certificates. When you finish adding tags, choose Request.</p> <ol> <li> <p>After the request is processed, the console returns you to your certificate list, where information about the new certificate is displayed.     a. A certificate enters status Pending validation upon being requested, unless it fails for any of the reasons given in the troubleshooting topic Certificate request fails. ACM makes repeated attempts to validate a certificate for 72 hours and then times out. If a certificate shows status Failed or Validation timed out, delete the request, correct the issue with DNS validation or Email validation, and try again. If validation succeeds, the certificate enters status Issued.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Depending on how you have ordered the list, a certificate you are looking for might not be immediately visible. You can click the black triangle at right to change the ordering. You can also navigate through multiple pages of certificates using the page numbers at upper-right.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Amazon Certificate Manager Documentation</p>"},{"location":"modules/jenkins/jenkins.html#optional-upload-secrets-to-aws-secrets-manager","title":"(Optional) Upload Secrets to AWS Secrets Manager","text":"<p>AWS Secrets Manager can be used to store sensitive information such as SSH keys and access tokens, which can then be made available to Jenkins.

It encapsulates all of the available modules alongside best practice deployments of core AWS services. The Simple Build Pipeline provisions a well-architected Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), a skeleton for managing DNS and SSL certificates with Route 53 and AWS Certificate Manager(ACM), Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, Perforce Helix Core for version control, Perforce Helix Swarm for code review, and Perforce Helix Authentication Service for external identity provider integrations.</p> <p>We recommend that you fork the Cloud Game Development Toolkit and then use this Simple Build Pipeline as the starting point for managing your studio's infrastructure.</p>"},{"location":"samples/simple-build-pipeline.html#predeployment","title":"Predeployment","text":"<p>There are a few prerequisites that need to be completed prior to deploying this sample architecture. We'll walk through those here.</p> <ol> <li>Domain Name System (DNS) Resolution</li> </ol> <p>The Simple Build Pipeline will deploy a number of web-based applications into your AWS account. The Cloud Game Development Toolkit attempts to follow a \"secure-by-default\" design pattern, so HTTPS is the standard protocol for all applications deployed by the Toolkit.</p> <p>All applications deployed by the Simple Build Pipeline use Route 53, Amazon's highly available and scalable DNS service, for routing traffic from the internet. All you need to provide is the root hosted zone you would like the Simple Build Pipeline to use, and your Jenkins and Perforce applications will be provisioned as sub-domains. Route53 will need to be able to validate ownership of this domain, so make sure you are using a domain that you have complete control over.</p> <p>If you do not have a domain yet you can register one through Route53.</p> <p>If you already have a domain with a different domain registrar you can leverage Route53 for DNS services. Please review the documentation for migrating to Route53 as your DNS provider.</p> <p>Regardless, the Simple Build Pipeline requires the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that you would like resources to be provisioned under. If you own the domain: \"example.com\" the simple build pipeline would deploy Jenkins to \"jenkins.example.com\" and Helix Swarm to \"swarm.helix.example.com\" - this can be modified from the <code>dns.tf</code> file.</p> <ol> <li>Jenkins Build Farm</li> </ol> <p>The Jenkins module provisions the Jenkins coordinator as a service on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). It also provisions any number of EC2 autoscaling groups to be used as build nodes by Jenkins, and any number of Amazon FSx for OpenZFS filesystems to be used as shared storage by those build nodes.</p> <p>By default, the Simple Build Pipelines will not provision any autoscaling groups or any filesystems. These are configured through the <code>local.tf</code> file.</p> <p>To add an autoscaling group you need to specify an instance type and an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). The instance type specifies the hardware of your build nodes, and the AMI contains all of the tooling and software you would like those machines to contain on startup. The Cloud Game Development Toolkit provides a number of Packer templates for useful game development AMIs. We recommend reviewing this documentation before adding build nodes to your Simple Build Pipeline.</p> <p>Your build nodes may also need access to credentials or other secrets. These can be uploaded to AWS Secrets Manager and then passed to your Jenkins build nodes with the <code>jenkins_agent_secret_arns</code> local variable.</p>"},{"location":"samples/simple-build-pipeline.html#deployment","title":"Deployment","text":"<p>Deployment of the Simple Build Pipeline is relatively straightforward once you have completed the prerequisites.

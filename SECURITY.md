## Overview

[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/aws-games/cloud-game-development-toolkit/badge)](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/aws-games/cloud-game-development-toolkit) [![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/9377/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/9377)

This project is maintained by members of the AWS for Games technical community within AWS (i.e. Solutions Architects, Technical Account Managers, Software Engineers) who support the gaming industry. Design decisions and tradeoffs made throughout this project reflect our experiences working with game studios to build and maintain their development infrastructure and tools in the cloud. We encourage contributions from the community via Pull Requests, which are manually reviewed and tested by the core maintainers of the project before they are merged.

We rely on [Open Source Security (OpenSSF) Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/) assessments to validate our project's security posture against a common set of open source project risks. We also self-certify our security practices against the standards defined by [OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en). The badges above are hyperlinks that you can follow to review the results of each.

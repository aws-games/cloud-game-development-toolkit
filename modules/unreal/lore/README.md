# Lore on AWS

Terraform module for deploying Lore — version control for large binary game assets — on AWS.

## What This Module Creates

- **Edge pods** — NVMe-cached nodes that clients connect to for push and clone
- **Durable backend** — S3 for fragments, DynamoDB for metadata (managed by the module)
- **Observability** — CloudWatch logs, optional X-Ray tracing

You provide: a container image and a list of allowed client CIDRs.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd examples/default
terraform init && terraform apply
```

Connect:

```bash
lore clone lores://<edge_pod_ip>:41337/my-repo
```

## Examples

| Example | What it adds |
|---------|--------------|
| [default](examples/default/) | 2 edge pods + durable backend |
| [cognito](examples/cognito/) | + Cognito auth, X-Ray tracing, deletion protection |
| [external-auth](examples/external-auth/) | + External IdP (Okta, Azure AD, etc.) |
| [minimal](examples/minimal/) | Backend only, no edge pods (dev/test) |

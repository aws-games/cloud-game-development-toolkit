# Modules

## Introduction

A module is an automated deployment of a game development workload (i.e. Jenkins, P4 Server, Unreal Horde) that is implemented as a Terraform module. They are designed to provide flexibility and customization via input variables with defaults based on typical deployment architectures. They are designed to be depended on from other modules (including your own root module), easily integrate with each other, and provide relevant outputs to simplify permissions, networking, and access.

> Note: While the project focuses on Terraform modules today, this project may expand to provide options for implementations built in other IaC tools such as AWS CDK in the future.

## Getting Started

### Module Source Options

Due to the structure of the toolkit, all modules will have unified incremental versions during our release process. To reference a specific version, simply have a different source on a module-by-module basis. The same applies to the commit hash option (though less clear to track changes so not recommended for most users).

Important, currently there is a staggered release process. When a PR is merged to main, that doesn't immediately trigger a new release. **‚ö†Ô∏è should we be doing this still?**

**Option 1: Git Release Tag (Recommended ‚úÖ)**
Use case: Explicit version tracking. Easy to pin to specific versions of modules.

```hcl
module "example_module" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/aws-games/cloud-game-development-toolkit.git//modules/path/to/module?ref=v1.1.5"
  # ... configuration
}
```

**Option 2: Specific Commit Hash**
Use case: If you want the latest and greatest, even before a release may be cut. As such we recommend caution with this option as well.

```hcl
module "example_module" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/aws-games/cloud-game-development-toolkit.git//modules/path/to/module?ref=abc123def456"
  # ... configuration (replace abc123def456 with actual commit hash)
}
```

**Option 3: Git Branch (‚ö†Ô∏è Caution)**
Use case: If you don't care about tracking versions and just want to use whatever is the latest. Due to the fact that you cant track versions with this, we recommend high caution using this method.

```hcl
module "example_module" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/aws-games/cloud-game-development-toolkit.git//modules/path/to/module?ref=main"
  # ... configuration
}
```

**Option 4: Submodule Reference**
You can also include the **CGD Toolkit** repository as a git submodule in your own infrastructure repository as a way of depending on the modules within an (existing) Terraform root module. Forking the **CGD Toolkit** and submoduling your fork may be a good approach if you intend to make changes to any modules. We recommend starting with the [Terraform module documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules) for a crash course in the way patterns that influence the way that the **CGD Toolkit** is designed. Note how you can use the [module source argument](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources) to declare modules that use the **CGD Toolkit**'s module source code.

### Basic Usage Pattern

```hcl
module "service" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/aws-games/cloud-game-development-toolkit.git//modules/service-name?ref=v1.2.0"

  # Access method
  access_method = "external"  # or "internal"

  # Networking
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  public_subnets = aws_subnet.public[*].id
  private_subnets = aws_subnet.private[*].id

  # Security
  allowed_external_cidrs = ["203.0.113.0/24"]  # Your office network

  # Service-specific configuration
  # ... see individual module documentation
}
```

# Modules

## Introduction

These modules simplify the deployment of common game development workloads on AWS. Some have pre-requisites that will be outlined in their respective documentation. They are designed to be depended on from other modules (including your own root module), easily integrate with each other, and provide relevant outputs to simplify permissions, networking, and access.

## How to include these modules

We've found that including the **CGD Toolkit** repository as a git submodule in your own infrastructure repository is a good way of depending on the modules within an (existing) Terraform root module. Forking the **CGD Toolkit** and submoduling your fork may be a good approach if you intend to make changes to any modules. We recommend starting with the [Terraform module documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules) for a crash course in the way the **CGD Toolkit** is designed. Note how you can use the [module source argument](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources) to declare modules that use the **CGD Toolkit**'s module source code.

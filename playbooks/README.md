# Cloud Game Development Toolkit Playbooks

This directory contains automation scripts for configuring workloads after deployment. We've selected Ansible as our IT automation platform, but we invision this directory will contain SSM run documents, Chef recipes, and potentially just plain, old bash scripts in the long term.

The isolation application configuration and infrastructure deployment was a deliberate decision by the development team to allow end users of the **Toolkit** to leverage the best tools for each job.

# Perforce Helix Core

[Perforce Helix Core](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core/aws) is a scalable version control system that helps teams manage code alongside large, digital assets and collaborate more effectively in one central, secure location. With AWS, teams can quickly deploy Helix Core and accelerate innovation.

This module deploys Perforce Helix Core on AWS using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that is included in the Cloud Game Development Toolkit. You can provision this AMI using [Hashicorp Packer](https://www.packer.io/). To get started, navigate to `/assets/packer/perforce/helix-core` and consult the documentation.

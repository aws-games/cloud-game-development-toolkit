# Welcome to the Cloud Game Development Toolkit

The **Cloud Game Development Toolkit (a.k.a. CGD Toolkit)** is a collection of templates and configurations for deploying game development infrastructure and tools on AWS.

!!! info
    **This project is under active development and community contributions are welcomed!**. If you would like to see something in this repository please create a <a href="https://github.com/aws-games/cloud-game-development-toolkit/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=Feature+request%3A+TITLE" target="_blank">feature request</a> in the Issues tab. If you'd like to contribute, raise a <a href="https://github.com/aws-games/cloud-game-development-toolkit/pulls/" target="_blank">pull request</a>. You'll find our contribution guidelines [here](./contributing.md).

The Cloud Game Development Toolkit (CGD Toolkit) is built with several key principles in mind:

- **Fork-first**. This project is intended to be forked so that you can use what you need and customize. Simply fork the repo, create your own branches for changes, and feel free to cut PRs to contribute your work back upstream. We encourage contributions.
- **Our expertise is AWS, and this project prioritizes solutions built to run on AWS**. It notably does not attempt to standardize for hosting on other platforms. If AWS is not your jam, that's okay, fork and customize as needed (see above).
- **Someting else**

# Welcome to the Cloud Game Development Toolkit

!!! info
    **This project is under active development and community contributions are welcomed!**. If you would like to see something in this repository please create a <a href="https://github.com/aws-games/cloud-game-development-toolkit/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=Feature+request%3A+TITLE" target="_blank">feature request</a> in the Issues tab. If you'd like to contribute, raise a <a href="https://github.com/aws-games/cloud-game-development-toolkit/pulls/" target="_blank">pull request</a>. You'll find our contribution guidelines [here](https://aws-games.github.io/cloud-game-development-toolkit/latest/contributing.html).

The **Cloud Game Development Toolkit (a.k.a. CGD Toolkit)** is a collection of templates and configurations for deploying game development infrastructure and tools on AWS.

Below are key tenets driving project's focus:

- **This is a fork-first, open-source project**. We know that every game project is unique, so fork the repo, create your own branches for customization, and sync as appropriate. If you build something that can benefit other game developers, feel free to share via PR, as we encourage contributions!
- **Meet game developers where they are**. We aim to minimize learning curves and introducing new technologies where possible by building solutions that incorporate tools and software that are already widely used across the game industry and among our existing AWS for Games customers.
- **Solutions are built for AWS**. This project is focused on improving the game development experience on AWS and does not try to standardize solutions for deployment across many hosting platforms. In our experience, doing so is generally difficult, unecessary, and fraught with tradeoffs. If AWS is not your jam, you're welcome to fork and customize as needed (see above)!
